# ProPresenter
Baseline ProPresenter 7 configuration for Grace Bible Church in College Station, Texas

To keep corporate worship and sermon presentations running smoothly for Worship Leaders, Pastors, and Production teams, weâ€™ve transitioned to using ProPresenter 7 with Blackmagic Design DeckLink output hardware across all Grace campuses in large corporate worship spaces, as well as in some medium auxiliary use spaces.

Staff and lay leaders maintain this repository for basic configuration version tracking as we produce useful starting templates for easy, modular deployment in new campuses, special events, auxiliary spaces, and to share with constituent partner ministries.

Herein we attempt to suggest best practices where universally applicable. Though some of these practices are considered System-wide operating standards, a majority merely represent best practices as proven by consistency, adaptability, and robustness under common use by both trained and untrained individuals in minimally supervised ministry environments.
